# RAPiD-nf

RAPiD is an RNASeq pipeline used and maintained by Ying-Chih Wang and Hardik Shah in the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciencese, Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mount Sinai [1]. While RAPiD is built on Mount Sinai's APOLLO framework [2], RAPiD-nf inherits the same pipeline structure and is ported to Nextflow pipeline engine [3].
